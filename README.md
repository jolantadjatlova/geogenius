# UX


## Website Intentions

**For the User:**


**For the Site Developer:**

## User Goals

## User Stories

[Back to contents](#contents)

## Agile Development Process



### Project Requirements & Scope

**Requirements:**

**Scope:**

### Planning Tools & Workflow



#### GitHub Projects (Kanban)
A Kanban board was set up in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/jolantadjatlova/projects/8) to manage all tasks visually. Tasks were broken into user stories and categorised by status:  
**To Do → In Progress → Done**

This helped me:
- Track progress easily
- Stay focused on achievable goals
- Maintain momentum without feeling overwhelmed

![GitHub Project](doc/github-project.png)

#### GitHub Issues
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jolantadjatlova/geogenius/issues) were used to:

- Document user stories and tasks
- Break down larger goals into manageable steps
- Track development progress for key features

Each issue was assigned a priority label using the MoSCoW method (e.g., must-have, should-have) to help focus on what was most essential for the MVP.

![GitHub Issues](will be added  screenshoot)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

## Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to map out the layout for mobile, tablet and desktop screens.

## Design Choices

### Typography


### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors").

![Color Palette](docs/geogenius-colour-palette.png) 

### Contrast Grid
Using Contrast Grid helped identify which colour pairings work best for the website in terms of readability and visual appeal, as well as which ones to avoid to maintain accessibility standards.
